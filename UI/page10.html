            <h2><u>Welcome to Experiment 10: Password Cracking using John the Ripper</u></h2>
        
            <h3><b>Introduction to John the Ripper</b></h3>
        
            <p>
                <b>John the Ripper</b> is a popular open-source password cracking tool. It was initially developed for Unix-based systems but now supports various other formats, including Windows and macOS. John is known for its ability to crack various password hashes, making it an essential tool for security professionals and penetration testers.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                John the Ripper uses <b>brute-force attacks</b> and <b>dictionary attacks</b> to try and match password hashes. It supports multiple hashing algorithms and can work with hashes from systems like Unix, Windows, and even web applications. Additionally, John can perform <b>password cracking using wordlists</b> and intelligently optimize its attack strategy to increase the chances of success.
            </p>
        
            <h3><b>Key Features of John the Ripper</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Crack a wide range of hash types</b>: including DES, MD5, and SHA1</li>
                <li><b>Supports wordlist-based attacks</b>: utilizing popular password lists such as rockyou.txt</li>
                <li><b>Customizable cracking rules</b>: to enhance brute-force and dictionary attacks</li>
                <li><b>Optimized for performance</b>: using multiple CPU cores and specialized algorithms for speed</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3><b>Use Case in Penetration Testing</b></h3>
            <p>
                During a penetration test or security assessment, an attacker may attempt to crack passwords using tools like John the Ripper. This experiment demonstrates how an attacker can crack a password by exploiting weak hashing methods or poor password choice. 
            </p>
        
            <h3><b>How it Works</b></h3>
            <p>
                The process begins with the attacker obtaining a file containing password hashes, typically from a vulnerable system. The hashes are then fed into John the Ripper, which begins its attack on the hashes. Using either a brute-force attack or dictionary attack, John will try different combinations to crack the password. Once cracked, the attacker gains access to the system or account associated with that password.
            </p>
        
            <h3><b>Common Hashing Algorithms Supported</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>MD5</b></li>
                <li><b>SHA1</b></li>
                <li><b>SHA-256</b></li>
                <li><b>DES</b></li>
                <li><b>LM</b></li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                Whether used for legitimate security testing or by malicious attackers, John the Ripper is a powerful tool in the world of password cracking.
