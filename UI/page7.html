            <h2><u>Welcome to Experiment 7: Vulnerability Scanning through Nessus</u></h2>
        
            <h3><b>Introduction to Nessus</b></h3>
        
            <p>
                <b>Nessus</b> is a widely used vulnerability scanner designed to identify potential security flaws in systems, networks, and applications. Developed by <b>Tenable, Inc.</b>, Nessus is considered one of the most comprehensive and efficient tools for vulnerability assessment in the cybersecurity industry.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Nessus performs deep scans to identify weaknesses such as missing patches, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers. It is equipped with an extensive database of known vulnerabilities, ensuring that it can detect a wide range of potential threats.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Nessus provides a range of scanning options, including:
            </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li><b>Network vulnerability scanning</b> to detect vulnerabilities in network devices, servers, and services.</li>
                <li><b>Web application scanning</b> to identify flaws in web applications such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure configurations.</li>
                <li><b>Compliance auditing</b> to check if systems meet security standards and best practices (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR).</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                One of Nessus' greatest strengths is its <b>easy-to-use interface</b> and the ability to perform <b>customized scans</b> based on your environment. It can scan individual systems, entire networks, or specific ports, helping you identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Nessus helps security professionals <b>prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities</b> by providing detailed reports with suggested actions, making it an essential tool for both proactive security monitoring and post-incident analysis.
