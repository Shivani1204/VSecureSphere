    <h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        In this experiment, we successfully explored how <b>IPTables</b> can be used to configure and manage a <b>firewall</b> on a Linux system. 
        By defining rules for <b>packet filtering, network security, and traffic control</b>, we gained hands-on experience in protecting a system from unauthorized access.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through practical application, we were able to:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Understand the fundamentals of firewalls</b> and their role in securing networks.</li>
            <li><b>Configure IPTables</b> to control incoming and outgoing network traffic.</li>
            <li>Define and apply <b>rules</b> to <b>allow or block</b> specific network connections.</li>
            <li>Explore different <b>tables and chains</b> in IPTables, such as the <b>filter, NAT, and mangle</b> tables.</li>
            <li>Implement rules to <b>allow essential services</b> like <b>SSH, HTTP, and DNS</b> while blocking unauthorized access.</li>
            <li>Analyze how <b>ICMP (ping requests)</b> and <b>port restrictions</b> enhance network security.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        This experiment emphasized the importance of a <b>properly configured firewall</b> in preventing cyber threats. 
        Firewalls act as the <b>first line of defense</b> in network security by filtering traffic and ensuring that only legitimate requests are processed. 
        By blocking <b>unnecessary ports and restricting specific protocols</b>, administrators can significantly reduce the risk of cyber attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, we explored how different <b>firewall policies</b> impact network security. 
        Setting the default policy to <b>DROP</b> ensures that all traffic is blocked unless explicitly allowed. 
        Using <b>logging mechanisms</b> within IPTables enables <b>monitoring and auditing</b> of network activities to detect potential security breaches.
    </p>

    <p>
        Furthermore, we observed how <b>IPTables rules</b> can be combined to create an <b>effective security strategy</b>. 
        By carefully structuring rules, organizations can <b>prevent unauthorized access</b>, <b>protect sensitive data</b>, and <b>ensure the availability of critical services</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, this experiment reinforced the significance of <b>firewalls in cybersecurity</b>. 
        Learning to configure and manage <b>IPTables</b> effectively is a crucial skill for <b>network administrators and security professionals</b>. 
        By applying these techniques in <b>real-world scenarios</b>, organizations can enhance their network security posture, detect potential threats early, and maintain a secure and resilient infrastructure.
