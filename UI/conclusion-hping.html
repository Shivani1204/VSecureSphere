            <h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this experiment, we successfully explored how <b>hping</b> can be used for <b>packet crafting, network analysis, and security testing</b>. By leveraging hping’s advanced capabilities, we gained hands-on experience in sending customized packets, analyzing network responses, and performing penetration testing.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Through practical application, we were able to:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Send ICMP, TCP, and UDP packets</b> to test network reachability and firewall rules.</li>
                    <li>Analyze <b>packet responses</b> to detect open, closed, and filtered ports.</li>
                    <li>Perform <b>TCP SYN scans (-S)</b> and understand how it differs from traditional port scanning.</li>
                    <li>Utilize <b>fragmentation (-f)</b> to evade firewall detection and analyze packet reconstruction.</li>
                    <li>Test <b>network latency</b> and measure response times for performance evaluation.</li>
                    <li>Simulate <b>Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks</b> in a controlled environment to understand security vulnerabilities.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        
            <p>
                This experiment highlighted the importance of <b>network security, intrusion detection, and traffic analysis</b>. By understanding how attackers might use tools like <b>hping</b> to probe and exploit networks, cybersecurity professionals can implement better <b>defensive mechanisms</b> such as firewall hardening, anomaly detection, and traffic filtering.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Additionally, we explored the impact of <b>packet timing, spoofing, and different flag combinations</b> on network behavior. These insights are valuable for <b>ethical hacking, penetration testing, and network forensics</b>, allowing security teams to identify potential risks and reinforce defenses.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Overall, this experiment reinforced the significance of <b>hping</b> as a powerful tool for <b>network diagnostics, security testing, and performance analysis</b>. By applying these techniques in <b>real-world scenarios</b>, professionals can enhance network security, detect vulnerabilities early, and safeguard critical infrastructure.
