            <h2><u>Procedure</u></h2>
        
            <h3><u>Step 1: Install Nessus</u></h3>
            <p>Before you can start scanning, you need to install Nessus. On Kali Linux, use the following command to install Nessus:</p>
            <pre>
            sudo apt install nessus
            </pre>
            <p>Once installed, start the Nessus service:</p>
            <pre>
            sudo systemctl start nessusd
            </pre>
            <p>You can check the status of Nessus with:</p>
            <pre>
            sudo systemctl status nessusd
            </pre>
            <p>Once Nessus is running, open a browser and go to <code>https://localhost:8834</code> to access the Nessus web interface.</p>
        
            <h3><u>Step 2: Set Up an Account</u></h3>
            <p>When you access Nessus for the first time, you'll be prompted to set up an account. Provide your email and create a password to log in.</p>
        
            <h3><u>Step 3: Start a New Scan</u></h3>
            <p>Once logged in, you’ll be on the Nessus dashboard. To create a new scan, click on the <b>New Scan</b> button.</p>
            <p>Choose the type of scan you want to run. For a basic vulnerability scan, select <b>Basic Network Scan</b>.</p>
        
            <h3><u>Step 4: Configure Scan Settings</u></h3>
            <p>In the scan configuration page:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter the target IP address or range of the system(s) you want to scan.</li>
                <li>Optionally, configure authentication or credentialed scans if needed.</li>
                <li>Set any advanced scan options as required (e.g., scan ports, detection settings).</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3><u>Step 5: Start the Scan</u></h3>
            <p>Once the scan is configured, click <b>Save</b> and then <b>Launch</b> to start the scan. Nessus will begin scanning the target system for vulnerabilities.</p>
        
            <h3><u>Step 6: Monitor Scan Progress</u></h3>
            <p>You can monitor the progress of the scan in real-time from the Nessus dashboard. The scan may take a few minutes depending on the number of systems being scanned and the complexity of the scan.</p>
        
            <h3><u>Step 7: Review Scan Results</u></h3>
            <p>Once the scan is complete, you’ll be able to see the results in the scan report. The results will include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Vulnerabilities:</b> A list of discovered vulnerabilities, categorized by severity (critical, high, medium, low).</li>
                <li><b>Detailed Description:</b> Information about each vulnerability, including its impact and possible exploits.</li>
                <li><b>Remediation Advice:</b> Recommendations on how to fix or mitigate each vulnerability.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3><u>Step 8: Address the Vulnerabilities</u></h3>
            <p>Based on the scan results, prioritize and address the vulnerabilities with the highest severity. Follow the remediation advice to patch or fix the vulnerabilities. Some common steps include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Applying security patches to the system.</li>
                <li>Disabling unnecessary services or ports.</li>
                <li>Changing weak or default passwords.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3><u>Step 9: Re-scan After Remediation</u></h3>
            <p>After remediating the vulnerabilities, re-scan the system to ensure that the issues have been resolved. This will help confirm the effectiveness of your fixes.</p>
        
            <h3><u>Step 10: Conclude the Experiment</u></h3>
            <p>Once all vulnerabilities have been addressed and the system is secure, conclude the experiment by discussing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The importance of regular vulnerability scanning in maintaining system security.</li>
                <li>The role of Nessus in identifying security risks and helping with remediation.</li>
                <li>How vulnerability management contributes to an overall cybersecurity strategy.</li>
            </ul>
