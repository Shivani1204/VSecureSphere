            <h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this experiment, we successfully explored how <b>Nmap</b> can be used for <b>network scanning</b> to gather critical information about <b>active hosts, open ports, and running services</b>. By performing various types of scans, we gained hands-on experience in <b>detecting live devices, analyzing network configurations, and understanding port states</b> in the context of cybersecurity.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Through practical application, we were able to:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Identify live hosts</b> on a network using different scanning techniques.</li>
                    <li><b>Detect open ports</b> and analyze the <b>services</b> running on them.</li>
                    <li>Understand the significance of different <b>scan types</b> such as <b>SYN Scan (-sS), TCP Connect Scan (-sT), UDP Scan (-sU), and OS Detection (-O)</b>.</li>
                    <li>Observe how the <b>Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)</b> enhances scanning capabilities by detecting <b>vulnerabilities</b> and performing <b>in-depth security audits</b>.</li>
                    <li>Analyze the role of <b>firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS)</b> in blocking or responding to scans.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        
            <p>
                This experiment emphasized the importance of <b>network security and proactive monitoring</b>. Open ports can serve as potential <b>entry points for attackers</b>, making regular scanning a necessary practice for organizations to safeguard their infrastructure. <b>Nmap</b> proves to be an <b>essential tool</b> for <b>security professionals and network administrators</b>, allowing them to <b>detect misconfigurations, identify outdated services, and ensure unnecessary ports remain closed</b>.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Furthermore, we explored how different <b>scan parameters and timing options</b> impact the efficiency of network scans. Using <b>optimized scan techniques</b> can help balance <b>speed and accuracy</b> while <b>avoiding detection by security systems</b>. Understanding these concepts is crucial for <b>ethical hacking, penetration testing, and cybersecurity defense strategies</b>.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Overall, this experiment reinforced the significance of <b>Nmap</b> in <b>cybersecurity and network management</b>. By applying these techniques in <b>real-world scenarios</b>, professionals can <b>strengthen network defenses, detect vulnerabilities early, and maintain a secure digital environment</b>.
