            <br>
            <p>
                In this experiment, we explored the fundamental concepts of an <b>Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</b> and its critical role in <b>identifying and responding to malicious activities</b> within a network. By simulating network attacks and analyzing traffic patterns, we gained hands-on experience in <b>monitoring, detecting, and responding to potential intrusions</b>.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Through practical implementation, we were able to:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Understand the architecture and working</b> of Host-based and Network-based IDS.</li>
                    <li><b>Deploy and configure open-source IDS tools</b> such as <b>Snort</b> or <b>Suricata</b> for real-time detection.</li>
                    <li>Analyze <b>network traffic logs</b> to identify patterns associated with known attack signatures.</li>
                    <li><b>Create and test custom rules</b> to detect specific intrusion attempts like port scanning or DoS attacks.</li>
                    <li>Learn how IDS alerts help <b>system administrators respond promptly</b> to security threats.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        
            <p>
                This experiment highlighted the importance of <b>real-time traffic analysis and rule-based detection</b> in maintaining network security. We also recognized the limitations of IDS, such as false positives and the inability to prevent attacks, emphasizing the need for <b>integration with other security systems like firewalls and SIEM</b>.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Additionally, we observed how <b>regular tuning of IDS rules</b> and <b>continuous monitoring</b> are vital for effective threat detection. The importance of <b>keeping signatures updated</b> and combining IDS with <b>threat intelligence feeds</b> was also evident for advanced protection.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Overall, this experiment reinforced the significance of incorporating IDS into an organization’s <b>defense-in-depth strategy</b>. A well-configured IDS acts as an early warning system, helping to <b>identify suspicious behavior, respond to threats faster, and improve the overall cybersecurity posture</b>.
