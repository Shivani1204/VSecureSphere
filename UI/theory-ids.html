            <h2><u>Theory</u></h2>
            <h3>This experiment demonstrates how an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), specifically <b>Snort</b>, is configured and used to detect network attacks in a controlled environment.</h3>
            
            <p><b>What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?</b><br>
            An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations. The primary goal of an IDS is to detect and alert system administrators to potential security breaches, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and other forms of cyberattacks.</p>
            
            <p><b>What is Snort?</b><br>
            Snort is a widely used, open-source IDS that analyzes network traffic in real-time to identify malicious behavior. It is capable of performing traffic analysis, protocol analysis, and content searching to detect various attacks, including buffer overflows, port scans, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</p>
            
            <p><b>Key Features of Snort:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-time traffic analysis and packet logging.</li>
                <li>Detection of various attacks such as DoS, DDoS, port scanning, and buffer overflows.</li>
                <li>Flexible rule-based detection system allowing custom rule creation.</li>
                <li>Can be used in intrusion detection or prevention mode (IDS or IPS).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><b>Understanding the Attack Flow:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>The attacker initiates a network attack from a Kali Linux machine, which could include a port scan, DoS, or brute-force attack.</li>
                <li>The victim machine, running Snort, monitors the network for suspicious activities.</li>
                <li>Snort analyzes the incoming traffic using predefined rules and identifies patterns associated with known attacks.</li>
                <li>Once an attack is detected, Snort generates an alert, providing detailed information about the attack.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><b>Why IDS is Important:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>IDS helps detect attacks and policy violations early, enabling system administrators to respond before significant damage occurs.</li>
                <li>It provides critical information for forensic analysis and post-incident investigation.</li>
                <li>IDS allows organizations to continuously monitor network activity and ensure compliance with security policies.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><b>Preventive Measures:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regularly update IDS signatures and rules to detect emerging threats.</li>
                <li>Ensure proper network segmentation and access control to minimize exposure to potential threats.</li>
                <li>Implement real-time alerts and integrate IDS with other security tools, such as SIEM systems, for centralized monitoring.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Through this experiment, learners will understand how IDS systems like Snort work, the types of attacks they can detect, and how to configure and interpret alerts generated by Snort when monitoring network traffic.</p>
