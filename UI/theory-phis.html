            <h2><u>Theory</u></h2>
            <h3>This experiment demonstrates how phishing attacks are carried out using the <b>Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)</b> on Kali Linux, and how unsuspecting users can fall victim to such attacks.</h3>
        
            <p><b>What is Phishing?</b><br>
            Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations or individuals to trick users into revealing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card numbers. This is often done through fake websites, emails, or messages that appear authentic.</p>
        
            <p><b>What is the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)?</b><br>
            The Social-Engineer Toolkit is an open-source penetration testing framework designed for social engineering attacks. It automates the process of launching phishing attacks and is commonly used in cybersecurity training and ethical hacking labs.</p>
        
            <p><b>Key Features of SET:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Credential harvesting through cloned login pages.</li>
                <li>Email spoofing and phishing email creation.</li>
                <li>Website attack vectors for fake authentication prompts.</li>
                <li>Browser exploits and payload delivery mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p><b>Understanding the Attack Flow:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>The attacker (Kali machine) launches SET and chooses a phishing attack vector.</li>
                <li>A fake login page (e.g., Facebook, Gmail) is hosted on the attacker machine.</li>
                <li>The victim (Ubuntu machine) visits the phishing URL assuming it is real.</li>
                <li>Once credentials are entered, they are captured by the attacker.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p><b>Why Phishing is Dangerous:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can lead to identity theft, data breaches, and financial loss.</li>
                <li>Often hard to detect due to realistic appearance of fake pages.</li>
                <li>Requires minimal technical knowledge to execute.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p><b>Preventive Measures:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always check URLs before entering credentials.</li>
                <li>Use two-factor authentication (2FA).</li>
                <li>Educate users on spotting phishing emails and sites.</li>
                <li>Use browser extensions and filters that block known phishing domains.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>Through this experiment, learners will understand how phishing attacks are launched and how attackers capture sensitive data, as well as the importance of user awareness and technical defenses in preventing such threats.</p>
