            <h2><u>Welcome to Experiment 2: Sniffing through Wireshark</u></h2>
        
            <h3><b>Introduction to Wireshark</b></h3>
            
            <p>
                <b>Wireshark</b> is a widely used <b>open-source network protocol analyzer</b> that allows users to capture and inspect network traffic in real time. 
                Originally developed by <b>Gerald Combs</b>, Wireshark has evolved into an <b>indispensable tool</b> for <b>network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, and developers</b>.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Wireshark enables users to <b>analyze packet-level data</b>, helping them <b>troubleshoot network issues, detect anomalies, and investigate security incidents</b>. 
                With its powerful <b>filtering</b> and <b>visualization capabilities</b>, it provides detailed insights into network traffic, making it a valuable tool for <b>debugging, forensic analysis, and security assessments</b>.
            </p>
        
            <h3><b>Key Features of Wireshark:</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Captures and analyzes <b>live network traffic</b> from various interfaces.</li>
                <li>Supports <b>hundreds of network protocols</b>, allowing in-depth analysis of data communication.</li>
                <li>Offers <b>packet filtering</b> using display filters to focus on specific data.</li>
                <li>Provides <b>real-time statistics</b> for performance monitoring and debugging.</li>
                <li>Allows for both <b>live capture</b> and <b>offline analysis</b> of saved packet data.</li>
                <li>Integrates with other cybersecurity tools for advanced <b>network security analysis</b>.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                One of Wireshark's key strengths is its ability to <b>dissect network traffic at the packet level</b>, offering detailed visibility into how data flows across a network.
                It is widely used for tasks such as <b>performance monitoring, intrusion detection, security auditing, and protocol development</b>. 
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Whether it`s used for <b>troubleshooting network issues, analyzing security threats, or understanding protocol behavior</b>, 
                Wireshark remains an <b>essential tool</b> for anyone working in networking and cybersecurity.
