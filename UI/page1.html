            <h3><b>Introduction to Nmap</b></h3>
        
            <p>
                <b>Nmap</b> (short for <i>Network Mapper</i>) is a widely used open-source tool designed for network exploration and security auditing. 
                Originally developed by <b>Gordon Lyon</b> (also known as <i>Fyodor</i>), Nmap has become an essential tool for network administrators and security professionals.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                It allows users to <b>discover devices on a network, identify open ports, and determine the services running on those ports</b>. 
                In addition to port scanning, Nmap can also perform <b>operating system detection</b> and <b>service version detection</b>, making it a powerful tool for vulnerability assessments.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                One of Nmap's key strengths is its <b>versatility</b>—it can scan anything from a single host to large networks, adjusting its speed and intensity as needed. 
                This flexibility makes it a valuable resource for tasks such as:
            </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li><b>Network inventory management</b></li>
                <li><b>Service upgrade scheduling</b></li>
                <li><b>Vulnerability detection</b></li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                Whether used for routine network maintenance or security testing, Nmap provides <b>detailed insights into the structure and security of a network</b>.
