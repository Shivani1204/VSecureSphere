            <h2><u>Theory</u></h2>
            <h3>This experiment demonstrates how vulnerability scans are performed using <b>Nessus</b> to identify potential security weaknesses in a target system.</h3>
        
            <p><b>What is Nessus?</b><br>
            Nessus is a widely used vulnerability scanner developed by Tenable. It is designed to identify and assess security vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Nessus performs automated network scans to detect misconfigurations, outdated software, and other vulnerabilities that may expose systems to attacks.</p>
        
            <p><b>How Nessus Works:</b><br>
            Nessus works by scanning target systems for known vulnerabilities, such as missing patches, misconfigured settings, and weak security policies. It compares the results of the scan to a database of known vulnerabilities and provides a report detailing the findings.</p>
        
            <p><b>Key Features of Nessus:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Network scanning to identify open ports and services running on those ports.</li>
                <li>Vulnerability detection across various platforms (Linux, Windows, MacOS, etc.).</li>
                <li>Detailed reporting on vulnerabilities, including their severity and potential impact.</li>
                <li>Ability to scan web applications, databases, and operating systems.</li>
                <li>Compliance checks for various standards like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and more.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p><b>Understanding the Scan Process:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>The user configures the Nessus scan, specifying the target system (e.g., an IP address or a URL).</li>
                <li>Nessus performs an in-depth scan to detect open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>The results are analyzed and categorized based on severity (high, medium, low). Critical vulnerabilities are flagged for remediation.</li>
                <li>The user reviews the scan results and follows the recommended steps to address the identified vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p><b>Why Vulnerability Scanning is Important:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helps identify potential weaknesses before they can be exploited by attackers.</li>
                <li>Ensures systems are up to date with the latest security patches and configurations.</li>
                <li>Supports compliance with industry standards and regulations (e.g., PCI-DSS, GDPR).</li>
                <li>Helps organizations proactively manage their security posture and reduce risk.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p><b>Preventive Measures After Scanning:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Apply patches and updates to vulnerable systems.</li>
                <li>Change default credentials and implement strong password policies.</li>
                <li>Ensure proper firewall and network segmentation practices are in place.</li>
                <li>Regularly schedule vulnerability scans to stay ahead of emerging threats.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>Through this experiment, learners will understand how to perform vulnerability assessments using Nessus, how to interpret the scan results, and how to remediate identified vulnerabilities to secure systems and networks.</p>
