            <h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
            <br>
        
            <p>In this experiment, we successfully learned how to use <b>Wireshark</b> to <b>capture, analyze, and interpret network traffic</b>, gaining valuable insights into the communication between devices on a network. By examining packet-level data, we understood how information is transmitted, how protocols function, and how network performance can be optimized.</p>
        
            <p>By exploring the <b>structure of network packets</b> and utilizing <b>filtering techniques</b>, we discovered how Wireshark serves as a powerful tool for <b>network administrators</b> and <b>security professionals</b> to:</p>
        
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
                • <b>Monitor</b> real-time network activity and identify abnormal patterns.<br>
                • <b>Detect</b> potential security threats, such as <b>unauthorized access, suspicious traffic, or malicious activities</b>.<br>
                • <b>Troubleshoot</b> network issues by analyzing <b>packet flow, latency, and bottlenecks</b>.<br>
                • <b>Investigate cybersecurity incidents</b> by reconstructing network traffic and identifying attack patterns.<br>
                • <b>Understand protocol behavior</b> by analyzing HTTP, TCP, UDP, ARP, DNS, and other network protocols.<br>
            </p>
        
            <p>Through <b>practical application</b>, we observed how <b>Wireshark’s deep packet inspection</b> enables professionals to diagnose and resolve network problems effectively. The ability to apply <b>display filters, capture filters, and follow TCP streams</b> provides a granular view of network behavior, making Wireshark an essential tool for troubleshooting complex network environments.</p>
        
            <p>The experiment also highlighted the significance of <b>continuous network monitoring</b> in various domains:</p>
        
            <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
                • Ensuring <b>optimal network performance</b> by detecting congestion and performance degradation.<br>
                • Quickly <b>identifying and responding</b> to potential security vulnerabilities and network intrusions.<br>
                • Assisting in <b>compliance and auditing</b> by maintaining logs of network activity and security incidents.<br>
                • Enhancing <b>cyber threat intelligence</b> by collecting and analyzing network data for proactive threat mitigation.<br>
            </p>
        
            <p>Furthermore, Wireshark is widely used in the fields of <b>network engineering, cybersecurity, digital forensics, and penetration testing</b>, making it a fundamental tool for professionals working in these areas. As cyber threats continue to evolve, understanding how to analyze network traffic becomes crucial for maintaining a secure and efficient digital infrastructure.</p>
        
            <p>Overall, <b>Wireshark</b> proves to be an <b>indispensable tool</b> for <b>network analysis, troubleshooting, security auditing, and forensic investigations</b>. By leveraging its capabilities, professionals can maintain a <b>secure, well-optimized, and resilient network environment</b>, ensuring smooth and safe communication across digital networks.</p>
